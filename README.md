# Math Lab Readme

## Purpose
This repository is a project I created to refresh my C++ skills.  This project was started around the time that Visual Studio 2022 came out, and I was curious to see how the first 64 bit implementation of Visual Studio compares to g++.

One of the first projects I tackle whenever I want to get a handle on new versions of languages, whether it be Java, Python or C++. I choose this project due fairly well documented methods of parallelization.

In this case it's was to try out some of the changes for the C++20 standard.

I have been working on this since mid November 2021, and decided I might as well put my changes up as I tried things, so that others can hopefully see what to do, or what not to do.

## Wiki

I also will place a Wiki up with both information on how to build, as well as hopefully document how I setup the project.

### Branch naming conventions

Each branch will be named **&lt;Version>.Description** With 00.Template as the initial checkin as well as template build, and master being my most recent version.

The Wiki will have a page describing what occured as each step is made.

Initial Branches

00.Template - Initial checkin.
01.Configuration - Initial project configuration in Visual Studio
